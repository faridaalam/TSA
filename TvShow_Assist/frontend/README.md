# Tv Show Assist
TV Show Assist
Our application will focus on users being able to find, share, and document their favorite TV shows.  Utilizing the TV Maze API the user will build a list of actors, shows, schedules, and episodes that encapsulate their tv tastes and likes. The user will also be able to create and maintain a profile that centers around their television likes and share with other “TV Show Assist” users.
